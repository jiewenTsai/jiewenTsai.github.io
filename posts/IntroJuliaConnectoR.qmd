I've just updated my Julia package, `ExtendedRtIrtModeling.jl`, to version 0.2.0. There are a few new features in there that I'll run through in the next few sections.

But that's not all! If you're an R user, I'll introduce you to an R package called `JuliaConnectoR` that lets you run Julia programs in R. It'll bridge the two languages seamlessly.

## Using in Julia

See the Github page.

## Using in R

All you have to do is to install and library the `JuliaConnectoR` as usual, and then you can use the `juliaImport` function to import any Julia package. The great thing is, it'll always download the newest version from Github, but not the stable one.

```{r}
library(JuliaConnectoR)
## You have to give a name to the Julia Environment.
ex <- juliaImport("ExtendedRtIrtModeling")
## See the objects in ex.
ls(ex)

```
